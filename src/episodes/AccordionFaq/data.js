        content: `So, can hedgehogs swim? When it comes to hedgehogs, 
        liking water is one thing, and swimming is another. Hedgehogs 
        are good swimmers and instinctively can start swimming without 
        any previous practice. In the wild, hedgehogs can run and swim 
        for up to 2km whilst searching for food each day.`

        content: `Hedgehogs are docile and nocturnal, which makes them 
        impractical for light sleepers, folks who are out until the wee 
        hours, or children hoping for a playful companion. When hedgehogs 
        feel threatened, they roll themselves into a tight ball and can easily 
        become injured if a human—or a dog or cat—tries to uncurl them.`
